# 📚 QUICK FINAL REVISION — TODAY'S FULL LEARNING SUMMARY:

⚡ **Day Summary (Quick as Rocket, Clear as Crystal):**

---

## 1. How Java Code Works:

- `package` name must match folder structure.
- `public class` must match file name.
- `main` method is the starting point.

✅ Example:
```java
package JAVADSA2025;
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

---

## 2. Variables and Data Types:

- `int`, `float`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`, `String`
- We can declare and print them.

✅ Example:
```java
int age = 20;
float price = 88.88f;
double pi = 3.14;
```

---

## 3. Default Values:

- Java **auto-fills** class-level variables if you don't assign.
- Memorized trick:

> "**No Number = 0, No Answer = false, No Letter = '\u0000', No Object = null!**"

✅ Default Table:

| Data Type | Default Value |
|:---|:---|
| int | 0 |
| float / double | 0.0 |
| char | '\u0000' |
| boolean | false |
| String (Object) | null |

✅ Important:  
- **Class Variables** get default values.
- **Local Variables** must be manually assigned.

---

## 4. Taking User Input (Scanner Class):

- We learned **how to read from keyboard** using Scanner tool.

✅ Important Lines:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
```

✅ Methods to take input:

| Type | Method |
|:---|:---|
| Full line | `sc.nextLine()` |
| Single int | `sc.nextInt()` |
| Single float | `sc.nextFloat()` |

✅ Example:
```java
System.out.println("Enter your age:");
int age = sc.nextInt();
```
